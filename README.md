## Attributions

This project builds upon the approaches outlined in:

**"Admission Prediction in Undergraduate Applications: an Interpretable Deep Learning Approach"**  
*Amisha Priyadarshini, Barbara Martinez‑Neda, and Sergio Gago‑Masagué*  
arXiv:2401.11698 (January 22, 2024)  
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11698](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11698)

The use of Feed‑Forward and Input Convex Neural Networks, along with LIME for interpretability, is inspired by their methodology.
